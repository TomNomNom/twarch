# twarch

A Twitter Archive... Thing. POC/WIP at the moment.

1. Unzip tweet archive in a dir called "tweets". 
2. Run `php create-db.php`
3. Run `php insert.php`
4. Use `php -S localhost:8080` or similar to spin up a web server for testing (if you're using PHP 5.4).

This might not work on PHP < 5.4; but will do eventually.
